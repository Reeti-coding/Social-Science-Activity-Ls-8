    <p> About Alexander The Great - 
        He is Ruler Of Macedonia. He was born in 356 BCE at Pella in Macedonia, the son of Philip II and Olympias (daughter of King Neoptolemus of Epirus). 
        From age 13 to 16 he was taught by Aristotle, who inspired him with an interest in philosophy, medicine, and scientific investigation, 
        but he was later to advance beyond his teacher’s narrow precept that non-Greeks should be treated as slaves. Left in charge of Macedonia in 340 during Philip’s attack on Byzantium, 
        Alexander defeated the Maedi, a Thracian people. Two years later he commanded the left wing at the Battle of Chaeronea, 
        in which Philip defeated the allied Greek states, and displayed personal courage in breaking the Sacred Band of Thebes, 
        an elite military corps composed of 150 pairs of lovers. A year later Philip divorced Olympias, and, after a quarrel at 
        a feast held to celebrate his father’s new marriage, Alexander and his mother fled to Epirus, and Alexander later went to Illyria. 
        Shortly afterward, father and son were reconciled and Alexander returned, but his position as heir was jeopardized. </p>
